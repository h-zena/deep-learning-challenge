Report on the Neural Network Model for Alphabet Soup
# Overview:
This analysis aims to create a deep learning model to predict the success of applicants funded by Alphabet Soup. We use metadata about past funded organizations to classify effectiveness ##of funding.
# Results
### Data Preprocessing
- Targets: IS_SUCCESSFUL
- Features: Various metadata columns
- Removed: EIN, NAME
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- Model Architecture: Three layers: input, two hidden, output
- Neurons & Activation: ReLU for hidden, sigmoid for output
- Performance: Achieved over 75% accuracy
- Optimization: Experimented with preprocessing and model tuning
# Summary
Our model achieved the target accuracy of over 75% in predicting funding effectiveness. Further optimization involved tweaking model architecture and preprocessing techniques. ## Alternative models like gradient boosting or random forest could provide further performance improvements.
